About this project: 
    Prime Checker is the first of many project in my upcoming journey to explore depths of python. 
    This project represents the relearning of fundamentals and the breaking of Java habits. It's my first attempt to work with python without the guidance of any walkthroughs.

DESCRIPTION:
    Prime checker is a lightweight program designed to check if a number is a prime value or not

INSTALLATION & USAGE:
    Currently not an app,
    to use: run script in Python 3

GOALS:
    As stated above, this project was primarily used to get my foot in the doors of python. Future goals include the further optimization of resource usage and speed of the program. 

CREDITS:
    All code is written and produced by me. 


DATES OF PRODUCTION: 
    initial commit: 09/02/25
